# HelloMorrisMoss

I am a Process Coordinator for the Manufacturing Technology group in R&D for a global corporation.

Much of my work is with Ignition SCADA by Inductive Automation. This uses Python in a Java interpreter (Jython) for scripting.

In addition to that, I do data engineering, analysis, and create custom software to support the manufacturing processes.
