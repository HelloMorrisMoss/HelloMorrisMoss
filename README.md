# HelloMorrisMoss

I am the 'AI Technology Specialist' for the largest manufacturing site in the country for a global corporation.

I oversee the manufacturing process data collection, storage, access, analyses, automated & bespoke reports, building custom software, and AI projects for R&D and Engineering.

Much of my work is with Ignition SCADA by Inductive Automation. This uses Python in a Java interpreter (Jython) for scripting.
